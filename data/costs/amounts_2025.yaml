notes:
  - "Coinsurance and deductibles reset by benefit period where applicable (e.g., Part A inpatient)."
  - "IRMAA thresholds use 2023 MAGI for 2025 premiums. Married-filing-separately rules differ at high incomes."
  - "Part D $2,000 cap applies to covered drugs; separate Prescription Payment Plan allows monthly smoothing."
